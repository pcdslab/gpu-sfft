# GPU-SFFT
The Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (MIT-SFFT) is an algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform of a signal with a sublinear time complexity,  i.e. algorithms with runtime complexity proportional to the sparsity level k,  where k is the number of non-zero coefficients of the signal in the frequency domain. The GPU-SFFT software is a  highly scalable GPU-based parallel algorithm for computing the SFFT of k-sparse signals. Our implementation of GPU-SFFT is based on parallel optimizations that leads to enormous speedups. These include carefully crafting parallel regions in the sequential MIT-SFFT code to exploit parallelism, and minimizing data movement between the CPU and the GPU. This allows us to exploit extreme parallelism for the CPU-GPU architectures and to maximize the number of concurrent threads executing instructions. Our experiments  show that our designed CPU-GPU specific optimizations lead to enormous decrease in the run times needed for computing the SFFT. Further we show that GPU-SFFT is 38x times faster than the MIT-SFFT and 5x faster than cuFFT, the NVIDIA CUDA Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library. More details about GPU-SFFT in our paper cited in the Publications section that follows.
